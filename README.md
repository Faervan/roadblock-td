# Roadblock TD
Roadblock TD was intended to be a grid based 2D tower defense game without predefined enemy paths.
The game should feel like a mix of "standard tower defense" (e.g. Kingdom Rush), featuring waves of enemies and live placement of towers to defeat them, and Clash Royal, in the way that towers and walls block enemy movement and enemies can destroy them if they can't find a way around.

This game is made using the [bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). The UI is made using [bevy lunex](https://github.com/bytestring-net/bevy_lunex), a UI layout engine for bevy.
